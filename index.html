            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>About me
                I came to the United States of America 6 years ago with the dream of persuading higher education. I got
                my first year studying English as Second Language to improve my English skills. After that, I submitted
                application to study at San Diego Miramar College where I spent almost 3 years with full of experiences
                in studying lower division courses in computer science and engineering fields. The first time I study
                coding is in CISC 190 which is taught by Professor Schulman, this class has given me the belief I could
                do something in this major. I learn Java programming language step by step and I also help one of my
                friend Gregory to study. After that I was really excited and surprised when I got accepted into UC San
                Diego at the end of April. I know it's time for me to step out of my comfort zone and really diving into
                challenges to grow. I had many memories and experiences during time studying at UC San Diego. I met many
                new friends who inspires me to study harder in this field. I have done several projects at UC San Diego
                which really helps me knowing how important that student with creativity can do to give solutions to
                problems for our community. After all, I love all the time I study at community college or university,
                it's extremely proud to be student at these schools. These memorable moments will be a part of my heart
                and my mind forever.</p>
